							<h2>The Metropolitan Museum of the Arts</h2>
							<p style="font-size: 80% ; margin: 0">	The Metropolitan Museum of Art is the largest art museum in the United States. It was originally funded by the city in the 1870s and was very popular since its origin. By 1904, the museum had outgrown most of its space and had to constantly expand in order to handle the amount of new art pieces.
The original building for the Met was a red brick and stone design, something considered outdated at the time. That building was poorly received by New Yorkers, so it got redesigned. The current building has many different notable parts, with the roof garden and the solar panel array being two notable parts. It's a very large museum, with 17 different structures being a part of it.
    Another notable part about the Museum is how large of a tourist attraction it is – on most days you can find the museum crowded with families from around the world, and along with that comes inflated food prices. The Met was the first major tourist attraction in New York I had ever visited by myself, and when I visited it for an art project in 9th grade, I finally discovered how overpriced food could be. I was used to a hot dog costing $2, but at the Met, that same hotdog cost $6. I didn't want to pay that much for a hot dog, so I left wondering who would buy anything that expensive – and as I walked away, a tourist family ordered 5 of them.</p>

							<h2>Bubbly Tea</h2>
							<p style="font-size: 95% ;margin: 0">Bubbly Tea is a hole in the wall store in Chinatown that’s pretty popular in Chinatown for its cheap bubble tea. Chinatown is a neighborhood which started off around the 1940s, when the mining business in the West Coast died down and the Chinese immigrants who moved to the U.S. wanted to move somewhere else. Many of them went to the East Coast, and settled down on Mott Street in NYC, which is now the heart of Chinatown. 
	In my freshman year of high school, I once followed some friends to Bubbly Tea after school ended, because I didn’t know how to get to Chinatown on my own. Because of that, when my friends left, I was stuck in the bubble tea place since I didn’t know how to make my way back to Tribeca. The only option I could think of was to keep drinking bubble tea until more students showed up, which I did – more kids from my school showed up 15 minutes later. By that time, I had already drunk like 5 cups of bubble tea, and made sure I’d never go exploring without Google Maps at the ready.

							<h2>City Hall Subway Station</h2>
							<p style="font-size: 95% ; margin: 0 ">The City Hall Subway Station was an abandoned subway station that was there since the beginning of the MTA - it was one of the first stations to be created, but fell out of use since it could only have 5 train cars visible at a time. It was an impressive feat of architecture, and still remains one to this day, but is closed to the general public. It was designed by Rafael Guastavino, who built it in a Romanesque style. To visit the station, you have to get on the 6 train at its last stop at the Brooklyn Bridge station, and you have to stay on the train after everyone leaves. The train eventually starts moving again and passes through the City Hall Station on its way to turn around to start the Brooklyn Bridge path in the opposite direction. 
	I remember this one because I was taking the 6 train one time and accidentally fell asleep on it, and when I woke up it was passing through the City Hall Abandoned Station. I thought I was going crazy when I saw a completely empty station until I learned about it a few weeks later.</p>

							<h2>Dialogue in the Dark</h2>
							<p>Dialogue in the Dark was an idea by Dr. Andreas Heinecke in 1988, when he had to train a young blind journalist and realized he didn't know how it felt like to be blind. Because of that, he decided to create an event to help people understand the difficulty that comes with the handicap of being blind and created a completely dark room where blind people and normal people alike would have to traverse a set of scenes.
	I went to this while it was in New York a couple years ago, and it was an eye-opening experience (no pun intended). They turned the lights off in the entire area completely and made us navigate across a simulation of a busy street and get onto a train. Losing one of the sense I took for granted was an interesting experience, and it was inspiring to see how easily the blind tour guides were able to lead us all to where we needed to go.</p>

							<h2>The Empire State Building</h2>
							<p style="margin: 0 ; font-size: 95%">The Empire State Building was supposed to be a 25 story office, but then the guy who owned it (Floyd Brown) couldn't pay off his loans for the building, and gave up on the idea of starting a business. He then sold that land to the Empire State Group, who wanted to join in on the ongoing skyscraper craze that was dominating New York City's skyline.		
	 The only reason the building has the spire on top and tapers off is because it was competing with the Chrysler Building for the title of world’s tallest building.The Empire State Building won, and it was 4 feet taller, but they added the crown to the building anyway because they were afraid the Chrysler Building might cheat by hiding a spire and raising it at the last minute.
 	 Despite all the work that went into the building, the Great Depression hit right as the building opened, so it was basically empty for about a decade and gained the nickname “The Empty State Building".</p>

							<h2>The Financial District</h2>
							<p>The Financial District is a large neighborhood in Manhattan which started out as a resting place for office workers after hours and grew into a massive place for trade and business, with the World Trade Center being at the center of that. Today it's a combination of a business district with places like Wall Street and a residential area for the affluent with places like Tribeca.
	The real reason I mentioned the Financial District is because of food. The best halal cart I've ever tried is on the corner of Warren Street and Greenwich Street, and they have the nicest owners too - I've seen somebody drop their halal from another cart and these guys offered another one to that guy for free. I've been eating at this place for years, and I'm legitimately contemplating taking the hour commute just to eat the food again.</p>

							<h2>Governor's Island</h2>
							<p style="font-size: 95% ; margin: 0">Governor's Island started out as a military location, with colonialists and the Continental Army using it as a fortification against naval attacks from elsewhere. George Washington used the island to fire shots on British ships while they were trying to enter New York, but he eventually lost the island to the British until the war ended.
	Once the war ended, people thought it wouldn't be put to use, but it was kept as a military base anyway, with two new forts being built upon it, which were called Fort Jay and Castle Williams. Both proved to be useful once the War of 1812 came around, and they were used to defend the city.	
	Nowadays, the place is an attraction for New Yorkers to walk or bike around, with nice scenery and a maze + rock climbing wall for kids. When I visited, it was a very open place, with a great view of the city. They have bikes that you can rent to ride around the island, and multiple different food carts that open up interesting food choices, making it nice for a visit on a warm day - especially since the ferry needed to go to it is free.

							<h2>Harlem Grown</h2>
							<p style="margin: 0 ; font-size: 90%">	Harlem Grown is an amazing little garden in the space of where an apartment building would be, ran by Tony who decided that the neighborhood needed a better leading example for the youth and a higher focus on the environment. When an apartment building in that space got torn down, Tony asked the city if he could use the water from the nearby hydrant to create a garden, and he got permission - since then, it's become a community center and an environmental boom. They have a greenhouse to grow plants to give out to homeless families once they grow, and they make their own compost to fertilize their crops using the trash of the city. They also run many different summer programs and use them to help the kids of the neighborhood have somewhere safe to stay and to become environmentally conscious.
	Tony is a great guy - when I worked there, I and a couple others working there tried to cut down a tree that was blocking lots of stuff off. The tree was stuck in the building next to us, so two people went to the building next to us, asked to borrow the balcony of a resident, and started cutting away the branches. I got to use a chainsaw to cut down the tree from the bottom, which was a hilarious experience considering I didn't really do it properly and it almost fell on me.</p>

							<h2>Roosevelt Island</h2>
							<p style="font-size: 95% ; margin: 0">After the English took over New York from the Dutch, Roosevelt Island was owned by Jacob Blackwell, whose house is one of the oldest in New York. After his death, Roosevelt Island became the location of many different hospitals after the city bought it, including the New York City Lunatic Asylum. That asylum eventually burned down and was rebuilt, alongside a smallpox hospital giving the island a bad reputation. In the late 19th century, the city started to clean up the island, creating multiple residential areas while keeping the architectural structures the place was famous for, and eventually adding attractions like the ferry and the bus specifically for the island.
	The only reason I'm mentioning this is that I've seen Roosevelt Island only once, back when I used to be in high school. I remember making plans to meet up with a friend at Roosevelt, and when I took the train from Manhattan I saw Roosevelt Island and I got off. That was the day I learned the difference between Roosevelt Island and Roosevelt Island - one has a view of the water and one doesn't.</p>

							<h2>J.P. Morgan</h2>
							<p>	J.P. Morgan was a businessman who became a multimillionaire in the 20th century through his investments. The reason why he's connected to New York is his library. Because of his wealth, he was able to keep a large space in the city as his own personal library and art gallery, where he kept rare one of a kind books like one of the original Gutenberg bibles and single copies of Voltaire's work. His art gallery also contains many beautiful works of art from Greek and Roman times, with a large extravagant art piece on the ceiling meant to amaze viewers who entered.
	The most interesting thing about the library was the story we heard from the guide about J.P. Morgan - one day he invited many affluent men to his library and locked them up until they agreed to his business proposals, showing how little he cared about wealth.</p>

							<h2>K.O.D</h2>
							<p>K.O.D is the name of J. Cole's newest album which released this week. J. Cole is a famous rapper who was born in Germany but came to New York and eventually got signed under Jay-Z's label. The reason I'm writing about him is that he shot a music video for a song he wrote called "False Prophets" literally in front of my house. That was the moment I really started listening to him, and while researching him I found out that he went to St. John's too.
	The funniest part about him going to St. Johns was that he originally majored in Computer Science, but changed his major to Communications and Business once he saw how lonely his computer science professors were. After graduating with a 3.8 GPA, he was supposed to get his degree when he came back to visit St. John's in 2015, but didn't get it because apparently, he owed money for never returning a library book, which I find hilarious.</p>

							<h2>The Lion King</h2>
							<p style="font-size: 90%; margin: 0">The Lion King was a famous musical based on the Disney movie under the same name. In 2014, it was said to have earned more than 6.2 billion worldwide, making it the most commercially successful piece of entertainment media at the box office ever. This makes us look at Broadway itself: how did the place turn into such a cultural icon, and how did it popularize the musical enough to overtake movie theaters which are everywhere?
	Theaters started opening in the city around 1750 but didn't become popular until P.T. Barnum made them popular around the mid 1800s, which was also when musicals were created, and the first one became popular. In the 1920s and 1930s, more and more theaters started being built in the Times Square area but didn't become massive until public transportation started getting cheaper and proper lighting at nighttime meant seeing musicals at night was safer. Musicals are by far my favorite form of entertainment, stemming from an acting class I took in 11th grade which let me view many late night Broadway shows for free - there's something unique about going home late while stewing in your own thoughts about a musical, and the story it tells.</p>

							<h2>MTA</h2>
							<p style="font-size: 80% ; margin: 0">	Anybody who's ever taken the MTA knows how terrible it is - constant delays, terrible smells, and lots of people yelling all the time. It's the most consistent source of pain for many New Yorkers, and that's about the only thing it's consistent at. Despite that, when you look at the overhead of such a massive system, you realize how hard it is to make sure there are no delays, and you kind of start to appreciate the work the MTA puts in to give us a gigantic public transit system - then they raise the price of a ride from $2.50 to $2.75 and you're angry all over again, circa a couple years ago.
	The MTA started off when the city wanted to take over control of the Long Island Railroad, and created an organization called the MCTA to handle it. Afterwards, the MCTA worked with New Jersey to connect the New Haven Railroad from New York to New Jersey, through the New York Central Railroad. Eventually, this all turned into the MTA by 1970. To get that straight, the MTA is a combination of the LIRR, the NYCTA, The New Haven Railroad, New York Central commuter services, and the Staten Island Railway, all under the MCTA which eventually dropped the C to become the MTA - in case you were wondering why the entire organization is so disorganized. Despite that, the MTA is part of what makes New York New York, even if we hate it at times.</p>

							<h2>New York Public Library</h2>
							<p style="font-size: 80% ; margin: 0">The New York Public Library started with the will of John Jacob Astor, who left millions after his death for the sole creation of a library with academic resources available for all. Around 5 years later, James Lenox created his own library, using his own collection to fill it - he was a philanthropist who loved books. in 1886, Samuel Tilden, a former New York governor, gave his fortune to be used for a library as well, but it was used to combine the two earlier libraries to create the NYPL, which coexisted with the Brooklyn and Queens library organizations that managed their own boroughs separately.
	Libraries are super important - many years ago, there was a push to move them out of taxpayer money, and many people fought back against it because of how much they valued their own local library. I'm definitely one of those people - I think the libraries are part of what defines New York and helps those without knowledge earn an easy way to attain it. The library next to my house helps immigrants learn English, helps old people learn how to use computers and helps kids get educational resources for their classes. Back when I was a kid, I used to take out so many books that if I was late by a day my card would basically halfway fill up with fines, so I spent hours reading in the library just to get rid of those fines through a program. It was a huge part of my childhood, and I can't stress how important they are to communities all around the city.</p>

							<h2>One World Trade Center</h2>
							<p style="margin: 0 ; font-size: 95%">The One World Trade Center is both the name of the Freedom Tower and the old North Tower of the previous World Trade Center. It's the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere and the 6th tallest in the world. It's designed by David Childs, the person who designed the Burj Khalifa, and relies almost completely on clean energy, making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in New York and possibly on the planet. The height of the tower is at an exact 1776 feet tall, signifying the year that America got its independence from Great Britain.
	The most interesting part of the Freedom Tower is that I got to see it be built in my lifetime - the building was finished once I entered high school right next to the building, and I got to see it open to the public in my freshman year. Being able to witness something so significant and being able to watch it grow into an iconic part of New York's skyline over the past 4 years has been an interesting experience, especially after visiting the 9/11 Memorial Museum to fully understand the significance behind it.</p>

							<h2>Captain Tilly Park</h2>
							<p>	Captain Tilly Park is a decently large sized park in Jamaica, Queens, which originated from the Tilly family. It was devoted to Captain George H. Tilly, who died in the American subjugation of the Phillipenes. His family previously used the land to raise ducks, but sold it to the city for a dollar to make it a public park. After some consideration, the park was named in Captain Tilly's honor, and there's a statue of him in the middle of the park.
	This park is probably where I spent most of my childhood - it's like a bootleg version of Central Park, except the lake is much dirtier than anything in Central Park. Despite that, it's still a nice park to walk or bike around, with a really large hill that's easy to hurt yourself biking down - I remember falling off my bike when I was a kid going down the hill because it was moving too fast. </p>

							<h2>Queens Museum</h2>
							<p style="margin: 0 ; font-size: 95%">	The Queens Museum is an educational Museum in the New York City Building, a place where the U.N. General Assembly used to be held. During the U.N.'s time at this location, they did many major things like partition Korea and make UNICEF. At the time, it switched between multiple different uses, becoming an art museum and an ice skating rink at different points in time. In 2009, it underwent a large renovation and modernized, moving the ice skating rink to the side and opening the entrance to the front.
	When I was in elementary school, we went on a trip to the Queens Museum, and it had multiple different amazing exhibits such as the miniature replica of the entire city of New York, and the glass walkway over it - I even remember the guide saying that the Empire State Building replica was 3 inches tall, and was used as the reference for the rest of the replica. It's an amazing place to visit just for seeing that replica, and the ice skating rink is also nice as well.</p>

							<h2>Xenophobia</h2>
							<p style="margin: 0">	Xenophobia, a noun; defined as intense or irrational dislike or fear of people from other countries. Racism has always been a touchy part of New York, but an unavoidable one ever since it's inception. Incidents like the Race Riots in Harlem in the 1960s and attacks on Muslims after 9/11 showcase how fear of others separates us. With the history of xenophobia in mind, it's easy to realize that this new presidency is making it a more pressing issue again.
	The interesting thing about Donald Trump is that he was literally born and raised next to St. Johns; he was born at Jamaica Hospital and lived in Jamaica Estates at a house really close to the school you can probably walk to and visit. When he grew up, he eventually was forced by his parents to go to the New York Military Academy because he went on trips to Manhattan without their permission. After high school, he went to Fordham, then transferred over to UPenn halfway through.</p>

On Hillside, many fast food stores come and go, many falling to the lack of business or to the prices not agreeing with the customers. Yummy's started out back when I was in middle school, and the $1 pizza that's been there for 6 years was a staple in my diet for a long time. There have been multiple one dollar pizza places, and there have been many fried chicken places that have come and gone - they started emptying when they raised their prices to $1.50 per slice or when they starting giving smaller slices. Yummy's hasn't changed its prices since I first went there - the pizza is still a dollar, and it's still good. 
	Back when I was going to a tutoring center nearby in middle school, Yummy's opened up and I started eating there because of the pizza slices. When I started talking with the owners, some friends and I started getting the other kids at the tutoring center to start going there, until it was constantly getting customers from our tutorial - the owner gave us free food sometimes as a thank you.</p>

							<h2>Bronx Zoo</h2>
							<p style="font-size: 95% ; margin: 0">	The Bronx Zoo is one of those pockets of New York that contains something distinctly non-urban; the animals feel exotic, and don't conform to what we think belongs in New York. Ever since its creation in 1899 by the New York Zoological Society, it has been a constant source for New Yorkers to find rare animals that couldn't be found anywhere else in the world. The first one was the thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian Tiger. After getting three of those animals who eventually perished, the species itself went extinct. The next one was the Barbary lion, which the zoo got a pair of in 1903. Those went extinct too, and now the zoo is focused on preserving North American wildlife, with the animal hospital being one attempt at that.
	As for my personal experience, I never got to witness how nice the Bronx Zoo was - I had one trip to the zoo during my childhood, and it was raining that day. I saw almost no animals, and the ones that I did see were either sleeping or relaxing far away out of the rain. I haven't visited since, but after looking at the history of it, I can understand the appeal it brings to both tourists and New Yorkers alike.</p>
